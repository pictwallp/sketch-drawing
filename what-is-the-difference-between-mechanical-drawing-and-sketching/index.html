            <p>The key difference between drawing and drafting is that drafting has to be technical in nature, while drawing doesn’t have to be technical. In other words, indicating on a drawing, the sizes of the object and the other details essential for its construction and function using lines, numerals, symbols, notes, etc., is called dimensioning.</p>


<p><strong>What Is The Difference Between Mechanical Drawing And Sketching</strong>, Diagram is a simplified illustration showing the appearance, structure, or workings of something. The 2d cad drafting is different than autocad in the sense that 2d cad drafting in solidworks is mainly for parts and assemblies whereas in autocad it can do anything. However, the lines between drawing, painting and sketch are blurred and it is not always clear where one ends and the other begins.</p>

<p>Sketches lack detail and have many lines that are part of the visual image. Drawing is the art or technique of representing an object or outlining a figure, plan, or sketch by means of lines. It includes dimensioning and callouts for features, including internal ones that might not be shown in a mechanical drawing. It’s used in mechanical drawing and design so that the structure created by a designer can be communicated to manufacturers and builders.</p>

<p>It could offer a view from any aspect, including perpendicular to the top, front, or side. All 2d drafting in solidworks is parametric, what that means is that, if you make any change to the associated 3d model, the drawing auto gets updated. Apart mechanical movement generally has shaped with axes of symmetry or flat faces. It helps people like me draw perfect circles and straight lines, and get things like perspective right. The outer edges of the rivet joint is hammered into seam. Concept drawing gives schematic pictures of how space is about to look like, this may be done either by freehand sketches or drawings.</p>
