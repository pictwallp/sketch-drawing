The number of cells in an organism determines its classification. Plant cell and animal cell plant and animal cells plant cell drawing plant cell. Animal cells and plant cells are similar in that they are both eukaryotic cells.these cells have a true nucleus, which houses dna and is separated from other cellular structures by a nuclear membrane. The important part is that it does not have any sharp edges.</p>
