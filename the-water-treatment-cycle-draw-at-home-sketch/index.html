When heat is added to water, its temperature rises at a rate of 0.56°c (1°f) for each heat input of 2.095 kj/kg (1 btu/lb) if we take water at 0°c (32°f) and we add 419 kj/kg (180 btu/lb) then we will increase the temperature of the water by 100°c (180°f) this rise in temperature can be detected and is called sensible heat Water is withdrawn from surface and groundwater sources and sent to water treatment plants.</p>
