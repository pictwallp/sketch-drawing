<p>Two main categories of metal casting processes. The work is done by passing the metal between the two rollers that rotate at the same speed but in the opposite direction. The different processes used for excavation comprises of trenching, wall shafts, tunneling, and others. This is accomplished by forcing the work through a mold, (die), of smaller cross sectional area than the work.</p>

<p>Processes metal casting metal forming metal rolling metal forging metal extrusion sheet metal powder processes metal drawing metal drawing is a manufacturing process that forms metal work stock by reducing its cross section. Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint).digital drawing is the act of drawing on graphics. Excavation drawings are needed to know the length, depth, and the width of the building excavation. Below is a review of five categories of uses with examples and links. In phosphating magnesium or iron phosphate is coated. The rolls rotate to draw the work into the gap between them and squeeze it.</p>

<p>The Cold Drawing Process for Steel Bars and Wire, Rolling is a process that is widely used and has very high production. The rolls are fitted with special kind of tapped section which used to form tapped cavity of cylindrical work piece. In this process both rollers are rotate in same direction and the bar is fed transversely. While lines form the basis of all drawing styles, line drawings.</p>

<p>What Is Deep Drawing ? Working Of Deep Drawing Sheet Metal, In metalworking, rolling is a metal forming process in which metal stock is passed through one or more pairs of rolls to reduce the thickness, to make the thickness uniform, and/or to impart a desired mechanical property.
