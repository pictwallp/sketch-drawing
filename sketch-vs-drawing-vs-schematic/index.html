<center>Difference Between Drawing and Illustration Comparison From pediaa.com</center>
<p>A schematic, or schematic diagram, is a representation of the elements of a system using abstract, graphic symbols rather than realistic pictures. As adjectives the difference between schematic and diagrammatic is that schematic is represented simply while diagrammatic is in the form of a diagram. As nouns the difference between schematic and diagram is that schematic is a drawing or sketch showing how a system works at an abstract level while diagram is a plan drawing sketch or outline to show how something works or show the relationships between the parts of a whole. A schematic usually omits all details that are not relevant to the key information the schematic is intended to convey, and may include oversimplified elements in order to make this essential meaning easier to grasp.</p>
