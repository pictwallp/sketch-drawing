<p>Sketching is basically done by pencils and charcoal, while drawing can be colour full using colour pencil, crayon, pastels etc. Here are some drawings by. In the engineering context, a sketch is usually quickly drawn by hand on paper, intended to show the approximate shape or appearance of a part, machine or structure. The purpose is to convey all the information necessary for manufacturing a product or a part.</p>

<p>Drawing usually means using drawing instruments, from compasses to computers to bring precision to the drawings. The difference between drawing and sketching is in the details. This cours is a tutoriel of engineering sketching and drawing. This is especially true for the engineer. It is a quick sketch with details but not to scale. If your making something that is less than simple it will almost always pay you to do some kind of drawing the try to get things straight in your head before you commit to cutting expensive materials up.</p>
