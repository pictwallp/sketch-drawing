<p>0.03 mol mass 4.68 g (4 ml) theoretical: (methyl alcohol) salicylic acid sulfuric acid 3. Salicylates, including salicylic acid (sa), methyl salicylate, saligenin and their respective glucosides, are natural products of plant metabolism that have long been known to possess therapeutic properties.as early as the 4th century b.c., willow bark, which is rich in salicylates was prescribed by hippocrates, for pain relief during childbirth [1,2]. Please clearly draw the overall reaction taking place between methyl salicylate and sodium hydroxide. You will need to look up the density of methanol. For the synthesis of each ester, add 20 drops of the alcohol and 10 drops of the carboxylic acid (or enough solid on the end of a spatula that is about the size of a large match head) to a small, labeled test tube.</p>
