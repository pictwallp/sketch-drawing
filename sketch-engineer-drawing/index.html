<p>These are used for drawing short straight lines, measuring and drawing certain angles. It is more than simply a drawing, it is a graphical language that communicates ideas and information. The instruments used in the engineering drawing are drawing board, mini drafter, t square, compass, divider, set squares, climograph, etc. The sketch is a drawing done quickly, but in engineering it has come to mean any drawing which is not a formal technical drawing. Drawing is used to record objects and actions of everyday life in an easily recognizable manner. Step 1 step 2 step 3</p>
