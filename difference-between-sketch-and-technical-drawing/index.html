<p><strong>Difference Between Sketch And Technical Drawing</strong>, Technical sketching differs from technical drawing: Technical drawings are blue print style drawings that display a products information, from dimensions like height, width and depth, to specified information such as materials or assembly details.

Artistic sketches, on the other hand, may have a range of interpretations for both the artist and the viewer. Drawing is the art or technique of representing an object or outlining a figure, plan, or sketch by means of lines.</p>
