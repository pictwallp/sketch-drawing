<p>It seems to be affecting pdf creation. Change the fonts for dimensoins in document properties and and you ll have your problem solved. Solidworks lets you specify the color of paper, borders, lines, and sketches as well as allowing you to customize the colors of sketch lines in a part file. If the drawing annotations (notes, dimensions, lines, etc.) are still appearing as a different color than what is defined by system options &gt; colors, then layers should be considered.</p>

I have tried changing the export pdf setting many times, two of the attempts are shown in. It seems to be affecting pdf creation. In drawing documents, view &gt; hide/show &gt; sketches affects sketches that exist in the featuremanager design tree only. If you use model items, you can bring in dimensions marked for drawing and not marked for drawing as well as other locating dimensions and annotations.</p>

In some cases, there is a problem with your sketch, but you cannot determine where the issue exists. Sketch entity alignment you can constrain sketch entities to geometry in multiple drawing views.

<p>SOLIDWORKS Making Quick Drawings YouTube, To hide all sketches use the hide/show items button in the heads up toolbar. Having that sketch shown in all views may cause some issues and for that reason we set any sketches that were not used for feature creation to “hide” in the part level. This question has a validated answer. When i save my drawing as a pdf,.</p>

Once the geometry has been traced, you can then fully define the sketch and use it in the same manner as any other sketches in solidworks. It’s not just sketch mode.

<p>Drawings SolidWorks — TDE /Design &amp; Engineering/, Accidentally you have checked the eye icon on top of your drawing. The way that solidworks works is that if the sketch is set to “show”, in other words, if the sketch was not hidden in the part level, it will show in all drawing views at the drawing level.
