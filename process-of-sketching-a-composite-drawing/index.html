<p><strong>Process Of Sketching A Composite Drawing</strong>, Sketch depicts the lower half off an oriole of a five story building. Isometric sketch or isometric drawing is a pictorial representation of an object in which all three dimensions are drawn at full scale.it looks like an isometric projection. Our objective is to construct a model p(i |i,(i i,i ),i =1:n) (1) to take an input image i and generate a sketch i that matches the style of the training examples.</p>

We split the model into two layers, global and local. The global layer aims to capture how the artist places each face element in the sketch image.</p>
