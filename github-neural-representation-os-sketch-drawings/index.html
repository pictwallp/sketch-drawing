<p>General representation of an artificial neural network, Sketch recognition techniques were utilized to recognize, evaluate and give feedback to the user�s handwriting samples. In our recent paper, “a neural representation of sketch drawings”, we present a generative recurrent neural network capable of producing sketches of common objects, with the goal of training a machine to draw and generalize abstract concepts in a manner similar to humans.
